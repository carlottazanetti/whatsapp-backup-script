WhatsApp Backup Script

This script automates the process of backing up WhatsApp files (Backups, 
Databases, and Media)
from an Android phone connected via USB. It uses ADB to access the phone's 
file system 
and copies files to a backup directory.

Features:
- Handles subfolders inside the main folders (Backups, Databases, Media)
- Skips existing files to avoid duplication

Usage:
1. Connect your phone to the PC via USB.
2. Ensure USB debugging is enabled on your phone.
3. Run the script. The script will list devices, and you can select which 
device to use.
